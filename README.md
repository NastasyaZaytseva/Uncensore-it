# Uncensor It 

## About 
Uncensor It is a web application designed for content creators in the field of sexual health. Built with Next.js, this tool aims to combat the issue of shadow bans on social media platforms. It intelligently regenerates captions or text content by replacing words that could trigger these bans with symbol-based alternatives. These substitutions ensure the content remains readable and accessible while navigating the restrictions of automated content moderation systems. 

## Features 
- Input Screen: A user-friendly interface where you can paste or type in the text content you wish to modify. 
- Text Modification: Utilizes a curated list of trigger words and replaces them with a safe symbol-based alternative. 
- Readability: Ensures that the modified text maintains a level of readability that's been thoroughly tested.
